   Project Description:
   
   - Write a multithreaded version of this algorithm in C/C++ that creates a 
   separate thread to generate a number of random points. The thread will 
   count the number of points that occur within the circle and store that 
   result in a global variable. When this thread has exited, the parent 
   thread will calculate and output the estimated value of π. It is worth 
   experimenting with the number of random points generated. As a general 
   rule, the greater the number of points, the closer the approximation to π.
